# CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Overview
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a labeled subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset, curated by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton.
This dataset is widely used for benchmarking machine learning and deep learning algorithms in image classification tasks.
CIFAR-10 consist of 60,000 32x32 pixel color images divided into 10 mutually exclusive classes. 
The dataset provides a balanced distribution of images across all classes, making it ideal for training and evulating models.

## Dataset Details
  
### Classes
CIFAR-10 contains 10 different classes, each with 6,000 images. The classes are as follows:

- **Airplane**
- **Automobile**
- **Bird**
- **Cat**
- **Deer**
- **Dog**
- **Frog**
- **Horse**
- **Ship**
- **Truck**

### Data Structure

#### Training Data
  - **Total Images:** 50,000 images
  - **Batch Division:**
    - Divided into 5 training batches, each containing 10,000 images.
    - Each batch contains a random mix of images across all classes.

#### Test Data
  - **Total Images:** 10,000 images
  - **Distribution:** Contains exactly 1,000 images per class.
