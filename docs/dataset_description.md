CIFAR-10 Dataset
----------------

## Overview
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a labeled subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset, curated by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton.
This dataset is widely used for benchmarking machine learning and deep learning algorithms in image classification tasks.
CIFAR-10 consist of 60,000 32x32 pixel color images divided into 10 mutually exclusive classes. 
The dataset provides a balanced distribution of images across all classes, making it ideal for training and evulating models.
